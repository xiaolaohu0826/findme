Performance

· Individual computer
  · Response time(execution time): time between start and completion
· Datacenter Manager
  · Several servers running inquiries submitted by many users
  · Throughput: Total amount of work done in a given time
  
  Register int is about 6 times faster than int

Logic Blocks:
Combinational: without memory
Sequential: with memory(storage)
Inputs and outputs are 1/0 (High/low voltage, true/false)

Computer work with current/voltage
V=IR
These quantities are continuous Plot: voltage vs time

• Discrete Signal
  • Signal is either high (1) or low (0). Binary Values, only two possibilities.
  • This is how we like our signals to occur in computer systems.
• Digital signals high(1) or low (0) flow in our computer circuits.
• Call these digital circuits, with inputs/outputs that can take on only 1 of two
possible values (0,1) where 1:true and 0:false

Analyze:
• First: Circuit analysis via Truth Tables
• Second: We will look at how exactly a binary ‘0’ and ‘1’ are represented

Suppose 3 inputs and 1 output
• Inputs and Outputs can only have binary values (0,1)
• Interested in output values for F =1 (true) or F =0 (denoted F )
• List all possible combination of inputs in a Table
  • XYZ (X=1 and Y=1 and Z=1)
  • XYZ (X=0 and Y=0 and Z=0) 
    ...
    •Truth table: specifies outputs for each possible input combination
    X Y Z F G
    0 0 0 0 1
    0 0 1 1 1
    0 1 0 0 1
    0 1 1 0 1
    1 0 0 0 1
    1 0 1 1 1
    1 1 0 1 1
    1 1 1 1 0
  • Complete description, of all combinations of inputs
  • We want to define output functions for F and G that are produced by
  this circuit or system
  • Interested in each value where F =1 (true) and G is true
  • Focus on F for now.
  • F is a combination of ‘minterms’ or minimal terms of the inputs 
  
Compact alternative: Boolean algebra
  • Variables (usually A, B,C or X,Y, Z) have values 0 or 1
  • OR (+) operator has result 1 iff either operand has value 1
  • AND (· ) operator has result 1 iff both operands have value 1
  A · B often written AB
  • NOT (¬) operator has result 1 iff operand has value 0
  ¬A usually written A
  
  • F = X Y Z + XY Z + XYZ + XYZ : Sum of Products
  • G is easier to define as G

Two-Level Representations
  • Any Boolean function can be represented as a sum of
  products (OR of ANDs) of literals
  • Each term in sum corresponds to a single line in truth table
  with value 1
  • This can be simplified by hand or by machine
  • Product of sums representation may also be useful
